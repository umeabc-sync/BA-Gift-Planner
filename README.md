This is a gift planner designed for players of the mobile game "Blue Archive". Built with Vue 3 and Vite, this project provides a clean, fast, and responsive interface to help players quickly find the optimal gifting strategy for the students whose bond levels they want to increase.

> [!NOTE]
> You might notice that this website has two names: BA Gift Planner and Sensei Harem Tool. BA Gift Planner was the tentative name in the early stages of the project, and I am still considering which name to unify it under.

## ✨ Key Features

> [!NOTE]
> The website currently supports English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Korean. If you would like to help me add support for other languages, please submit a [PR](https://github.com/Yuuzi261/BA-Gift-Planner/pulls).

### Gift Recommendation Page

1️⃣ Open the character selector and choose your ~~waifus😋~~... I mean, students.

![Character Selector Screenshot](./docs/imgs/1.png)

2️⃣ Close the character selector to see the results (yes, it's that simple!). Here, I'm only showing a part of the results.

![Results Display](./docs/imgs/2.png)

Students who are not the best choice will have a semi-transparent + dashed border effect. If you don't want to see non-optimal choices, you can change the settings in the settings interface:

3️⃣ Check which gifts can be given freely (SSR) or used to craft a Gift Selection Box (SR).

4️⃣ Alright, now you can open the game and start building relationships with your students. No more worrying about giving the wrong gift or not knowing which gifts can be used for crafting! 🎉

👉 In addition, you can use the share button to share your selected student combination link with others. You can also download screenshots of the current combination. The screenshots are available in two styles, both applying the optimal choices calculated above:

- **Gift Recommendation** (gift-oriented view matching students who like the gift):

- **Student Preference** (student-oriented view matching the favorite gifts of each student):

These features make bond calculation simple. It's convenient whether you want to sync your in-game progress for meticulous affection planning, simply set approximate values to see how far you are from your goal, or find out what you can achieve with your current gift inventory.

### Cloud Sync & Backup

Tired of losing your data when switching browsers or devices? The cloud sync feature allows you to sync your gift inventory and student bond progress across multiple devices. Currently, it only supports Google Login. You can also manually import/export to manage your data.

### Character Presets

Supports saving up to 10 character presets for easier management! You can also load presets shared by others via a link.
